  This is an application that builds ML models on the [Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). Currently there are two models 
  - Logistic Regression
  - LightGBM

 This application provides an efficient and a fast way to try different models and their hyperparameters in just a few clicks. 
 You can also extend this application to different datasets and save the models to make predictions for new entities.
